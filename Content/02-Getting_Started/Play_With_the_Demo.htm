            <MadCap:keyword term="Demo:Demo Map file:open" />The first time InterMapper launches, it will open a Demo Map file that 
 shows simulated network activity: outages, high traffic, and other problems 
 that you'd see in a real network. (Although not as frequently, we hope...) 
 </p>
        <p>The image below shows a portion of an example map with a number of devices 
 (rectangles) connected by various kinds of links (lines). </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/DemoMap2.png" style="width: 580px;height: 381px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Here are some tips 
 to help you understand the various items on the map:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Devices are displayed in <b>green</b> to indicate that the 
 device is up and running. </li>
            <li>Devices that are down <b>blink red</b> when InterMapper 
 cannot communicate with them. </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Click and hold</b> a device 
 to see a status window of detailed information and outage history, or <b>Right/Ctrl-click</b> it and choose <b style="font-style: italic;">Status Window</b> from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>You can <b>tear off</b> these status windows to keep them 
 open by dragging the mouse outside their boundary. </li>
            <li>You'll hear <b>sounds</b><MadCap:keyword term="E-mail" /> to indicate that there have been 
 failures. (InterMapper can send e-mail or pages, too!) To silence these 
 alarms, choose      <b><MadCap:keyword term="Suspend Sounds" />Preferences...</b> from the      <b>Edit</b> menu, click the <b style="font-style: italic;">Sounds</b> subcategory of the <b style="font-style: italic;">Behavior</b> category and clear the <b style="font-style: italic;">Play sound notifications</b> check box.</li>
            <li>Lines (<i>links</i>) show      <b>dotted lines</b> (<i>ants</i>) <MadCap:keyword term="ants" />when traffic exceeds a threshold </li>
            <li>Links get a <b>yellow or orange background</b> when traffic 
 exceeds 50% or 90%, respectively. </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Circles at the ends of links</b> 
      (they look like raindrops in puddles) indicate errors that have been detected 
 by the interface. </li>
            <li><b>Circles close to the device</b> indicate receive errors.</li>
            <li><b> Circles close to the network</b> indicate transmit errors. </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Click and hold on a link</b>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Port/interface" /> 
      to see a status window of port/interface information and traffic statistics, or <b>Right/Ctrl-click</b> it and choose <b style="font-style: italic;">Status Window</b> from the dropdown menu.
    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, there are other things you may note on the map as it operates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some devices become dim from time to time. That's because 
 they're being <i>shadowed</i> by another failure on the map. We also say 
 that those shadowed devices      <i>depend</i> on all the devices on the path 
 to it. InterMapper can automatically detect this state and will avoid notifying 
 the network manager about outages if the dependent devices are unreachable 
 because of the other failure. </li>
            <li>On several of the demo maps, a star appears on a device. That means that it's the <i><MadCap:keyword term="Vantage Point" />Vantage Point</i> for "shadowing". 
 InterMapper will suppress notifications for a device if it's not possible 
 to reach the device from the Vantage Point without going through a failed 
 device. (It's in the "shadow" of a failed device.")</li>
        </ul>
