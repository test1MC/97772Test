        <p>This is a general probe for monitoring wireless gear for which there is no specific InterMapper probe, but that supports SNMP MIB-2. This probe will gather general traffic information, network connections, etc. It also adds an alarm when traffic on a user-selected interface reaches specified levels. </p><a name="smartBridges"></a>

Please install InterMapper on a machine where you don't plan to run smartBridges simpleMonitor. To be able to run both InterMapper and smartBridges' simpleMonitor on the same machine, you will need to disable trap processing in InterMapper.</p><a name="3"></a>

        <p>This probe monitors a smartBridges airPoint device. It retrieves and displays information from the AT76C510 MIB using SNMP v1. Depending on the brige's operating mode this probe will display different information. </p>
        <p>If device is operating as a wireless client or a wireless repeater, the probe will display information about the connection to the parent access point (ESSID, SSID, channel, RSSI, link quality). </p>
        <p>If the device is operating as a wireless bridge (either point-to-point or point-to-multipoint), the probe will display the list of authorized MAC addresses. </p>
        <p>If the operating mode is a wireless repeater or access point, the probe will monitor the number of clients and list each one with its RSSI/link quality. </p>
        <p>It retrieves and displays a number of traffic (bytes received/transmitted) and physical variables (name, MAC address, firmware revision). </p>
        <p>This probe may not return complete information to SNMPv1 clients using the community string "public". To fully utilize this probe, you must set the community string to the one with the correct permissions.</p>
        <p>Please install InterMapper on a machine where you don't plan to run smartBridges simpleMonitor. To be able to run both InterMapper and smartBridges' simpleMonitor on the same machine, you will need to disable trap processing in InterMapper.</p><a name="9"></a>
