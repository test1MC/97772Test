            <MadCap:keyword term="State" />InterMapper saves its state the <i><MadCap:keyword term="InterMapper Settings" /><MadCap:keyword term="State:InterMapper Settings" />InterMapper Settings</i> folder.</p>
        <p>As described in <a href="filesfolders.html">InterMapper Files and Folders</a><MadCap:keyword term="Windows" />, 
	the InterMapper Settings folder is in different locations, depending on whether it is installed in Windows or Unix/Linux/Mac 
	OS X.</p>
        <p><b>To backup InterMapper on any of these systems, </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Back up the <i>InterMapper Settings</i> folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> When making backups of the InterMapper Settings folder on Windows installations, it is important to stop the InterMapper Server before making a backup, or make sure that your backup mechanism allows files to be accessible by InterMapper simultaneously. Opening certain types of chart or log files can cause them to be inaccessible to InterMapper, causing the InterMapper Server to stop abruptly.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Older Formats" />Retaining Copies of Maps in Older Formats</h2>
        <p>A new version of InterMapper can use a file data structure which is different 
 from previous versions. To preserve the ability to "go back" to an earlier version, InterMapper creates a copy of the current maps when you install a new version of InterMapper, named with the new version number. This becomes the copy that contains active maps. </p>
        <p>The old maps are moved to a folder named with the previous version number. If you need to revert to an earlier version of InterMapper, you can 
	get your original maps from the folder whose name corresponds with the version you want to run. In subsequent releases, the folder that corresponds to the current version is used automatically.</p>
