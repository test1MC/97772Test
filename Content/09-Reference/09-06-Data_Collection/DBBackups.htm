        <h1 class="L2">Configuring Automatic Database Backups</h1>
        <p>InterMapper Database can automatically create back-ups of its built-in database. Please keep in mind that creating a backup can consume a lot of disk space, and takes time to complete.</p>
        <p><b>To set up automatic backups:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the InterMapper Database Settings page, click <b style="font-style: italic;">Automatic Backups</b>. The Automatic Database Backups page appears.</li>
            <li>Set the period you want to use for backing up. You do backups daily or weekly.</li>
            <li>For daily backups, set the time you want the backup to start. For weekly backups, set the day and time.</li>
            <li>Specify the maximum number of backups you want to store. Once this number of backups is reached, the oldest backup is deleted each time a new one is created.</li>
            <li>Click <b style="font-style: italic;">Save Settings</b>. The backup settings are saved, and backups are created according to the specified schedule.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Creating an unscheduled backup</h3>
        <p>You can create a backup at any time.</p>
        <p><b>To create a backup:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click <b style="font-style: italic;">Create Backup</b>. A new backup file is created immediately. The backup starts immediately. When finished, the backup file is listed in the <b style="font-style: italic;">Available Backups</b> box.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Restoring a previous backup</h3>
        <p>You can restore a previous backup. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <b style="font-style: italic;">Available Backups</b> box, click the backup file you want to restore.</li>
            <li>Click <b style="font-style: italic;">Restore</b>. Data from the selected backup is restored to the InterMapper Database.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Viewing backup progress and canceling backups</h3>
        <p>When a backup is underway, you can view its progress from the Automatic Database Backups page. You can also cancel a backup while it is under way. </p>
        <p>To view backup progress or cancel a backup:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While the backup is under way, go to the Automatic Database Backups page. The progress bar appears.</li>
            <li>Click <b style="font-style: italic;">Abort</b> to cancel the current backup.</li>
        </ul>
