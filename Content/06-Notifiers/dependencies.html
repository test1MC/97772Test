            <MadCap:keyword term="Using Notification Dependencies" />Using Vantage Points</h1>
        <p>InterMapper can block or suppress notifications for devices that are "behind" 
	or "shadowed by" another failed device. This helps you avoid receiving 
	dozens (or hundreds) of notifications for devices that don't respond because 
	there is a router or link down between InterMapper and that device. </p>
        <p>When one device is dependent on another, you can use this dependency to 
 suppress the notifications for devices that depend on the failed 
 device.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Set" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Vantage Point:set" />There's no need to set the dependencies manually between devices on 
 a map. Instead, InterMapper follows the links that are already part of 
 the map.</p>
        <p>To enable dependencies, you <a href="#setreferencepoint">set a <i>Vantage 
 Point</i><MadCap:xref href="#setreferencepoint" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" /></a><MadCap:keyword term="Set:Vantage Point" /><MadCap:keyword term="Remove:Vantage Point" /><MadCap:keyword term="Move:Vantage Point" /><MadCap:keyword term="Vantage Point" />. The Vantage Point indicates the position from which InterMapper 
 views the network. You usually set the Vantage Point on the actual device 
 where InterMapper is running. Once you've set the Vantage Point, InterMapper 
 can determine which devices are dependent on which other devices.</p>
        <p><b>Example 1: All devices are up</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="InterMapper icon" />The example below shows a map with several interconnected routers. The 
 yellow star on the InterMapper icon shows that it is the map's vantage 
 point.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Example 2: One device is down, shows dependent devices</b>
        </p>
        <p>In this example, Router2 has failed. InterMapper will send the normal 
 notifications for Router2, but it will suppress notifications for any 
 of the devices that depend on it. Those dependent devices' icons are dimmed 
 on the map to show they're being shadowed by the failure.</p>

 from the dropdown menu's Set Info submenu.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A star next to the item disappears, and no Vantage Point is set. Notifications 
 are sent for all map items.</p>
        <h2>How Vantage Points Work</h2>
        <p>When a device goes down (when no response has been received from it),dependencies are used to determine whether to suppress the 
 notification. </p>
        <p>Starting at the Vantage Point, InterMapper follows the links 
 toward the device in question. If the only path to that device passes through a device, a link, or an interface 
 that's already down, InterMapper knows that the device is shadowed, dims 
 its icon, and suppresses the notifications. </p>
        <p>If there is no failure along the path, or if there is no path at all 
 (functional or not) to the device, InterMapper allows the notification 
 to go through.</p>
        <p>Even though a device is shadowed (and its notifications are suppressed), 
 InterMapper continually probes the device to show its status.</p>
        <h2>One Vantage Point Per Map</h2>
        <p>You can define only one Vantage Point per map.  Even if a map does not show the machine on which the server is running, you can use the Vantage Point to indicate the communication path from the InterMapper server to the devices on the map. </p>
        <p>This allows InterMapper to know which devices are inaccessible if a switch or router goes down.</p>
        <h2>Managing Notifications for Dependent Devices</h2>
        <p>If a device fails but has not yet been polled, it is possible for notifications for dependent devices to be sent even though the failed device is responsible for the failure. This can result in a number of unnecessary and inaccurate alerts being sent.</p>
        <p>In this situation, configure the notifiers for the dependent devices to have a delay that is longer than a single polling cycle of the device on which they depend. In this setup, the dependent devices do not send an alert if the device on which they depend goes down. An alert is sent only for the failed device.</p>
