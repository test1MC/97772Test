&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;Introduction
&#160;&#160;&#160;============
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
&#160;&#160;&#160;  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
&#160;&#160;&#160;  FreeType Project.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
&#160;&#160;&#160;  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
&#160;&#160;&#160;  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
&#160;&#160;&#160;  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
&#160;&#160;&#160;  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
&#160;&#160;&#160;  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
&#160;&#160;&#160;  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  FreeType code. (`credits')
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
&#160;&#160;&#160;  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
&#160;&#160;&#160;  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
&#160;&#160;&#160;  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
&#160;&#160;&#160;  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
&#160;&#160;&#160;  encourage you to use the following text:

&#160;&#160;&#160;  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
&#160;&#160;&#160;  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
&#160;&#160;&#160;  beta or final release.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
&#160;&#160;&#160;  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
&#160;&#160;&#160;  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
&#160;&#160;&#160;  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
&#160;&#160;&#160;  engine'.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
&#160;&#160;&#160;  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
&#160;&#160;&#160;  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
&#160;&#160;&#160;  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
&#160;&#160;&#160;  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
&#160;&#160;&#160;  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
&#160;&#160;&#160;  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
&#160;&#160;&#160;  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid

&#160;&#160;&#160;These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,

&#160;&#160;&#160;Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
&#160;&#160;&#160;in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from

&#160;&#160;&#160;ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
&#160;&#160;&#160;sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
&#160;&#160;&#160;ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
&#160;&#160;&#160;by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
&#160;&#160;&#160;that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
&#160;&#160;&#160;ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
&#160;&#160;&#160;of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
&#160;&#160;&#160;the foregoing paragraphs do.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
&#160;&#160;&#160;It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
&#160;&#160;&#160;The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
&#160;&#160;&#160;ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
&#160;&#160;&#160;by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
&#160;&#160;&#160;To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
&#160;&#160;&#160;been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
&#160;&#160;&#160;"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
&#160;&#160;&#160;resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
&#160;&#160;&#160;GIF decoders.
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;We are required to state that
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of

        <h2>psycopg<a name="psycopg"></a></h2><pre class="code">psycopg and the GPL
===================

psycopg is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version. See file COPYING for details.

As a special exception, specific permission is granted for the GPLed
code in this distribition to be linked to OpenSSL and PostgreSQL libpq
without invoking GPL clause 2(b).

Note that the GPL was chosen to avoid proprietary adapters based on
psycopg code. Using psycopg in a proprietary product (even bundling
psycopg with the proprietary product) is fine as long as:

 1. psycopg is called from Python only using only the provided API
    (i.e., no linking with C code and no C modules based on it); and

 2. all the other points of the GPL are respected (you offer a copy
    of psycopg's source code, and so on.)

Alternative licenses
====================

If you prefer you can use the Zope Database Adapter ZPsycopgDA (i.e.,
every file inside the ZPsycopgDA directory) user the ZPL license as
published on the Zope web site, http://www.zope.org/Resources/ZPL.

Also, the following BSD-like license applies (at your option) to the
files following the pattern psycopg/adapter*.{h,c} and
psycopg/microprotocol*.{h,c}:

 Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
 including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
 freely, subject to the following restrictions:

 1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
    claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this
    software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation
    would be appreciated but is not required.
 
 2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not
    be misrepresented as being the original software.
 
 3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.

psycopg is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

Proprietary licenses
====================

A non-exclusive license is available for companies that want to include
psycopg in their proprietary products without respecting the spirit of the
GPL. The price of the license is one day of development done by the author,
at the consulting fee he applies to his usual customers at the day of the
request.

        <h2>python<a name="python"></a></h2><pre class="code">A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
