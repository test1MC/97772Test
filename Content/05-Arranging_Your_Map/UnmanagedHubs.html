        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="IP" />InterMapper cannot automatically discover or monitor unmanaged switches and 
	hubs (so-called 'dumb' devices) since they have no IP address. However, there 
	is a workaround that allows you to represent them on an InterMapper map.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Interconnections" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Interconnections:display" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Link" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Display" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Display:interconnections" />To do this, you can create a placeholder icon, and then manually drag the 
	links from the appropriate devices to this new icon. Although InterMapper 
	cannot test or monitor this "fake" equipment, it will appear on the map and 
	display the interconnections of your network as a tool to diagnose problems.</p>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step description of the process. Note that
this description works equally well for either switches or
hubs.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Label" />In the starting map, notice that InterMapper has automatically connected 
 a number of devices to the network oval labeled "192.168.1.0/24". We happen 
 to know that the top three devices --IP addresses 192.168.1.91, .89, and .79-- 
 are in fact, connected to a dumb (e.g., unmanaged) hub on the floor above. 
 This page shows how to create a placeholder icon to represent the hub and 
 connect those three devices to it.</p>
