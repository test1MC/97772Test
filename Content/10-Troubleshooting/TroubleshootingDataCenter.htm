        <h2><a name="differentURL"></a>I get an error message: "This InterMapper Server already appears to be associated with the InterMapper
Database. Existing UUID is associated with a different URL"</h2>
        <p>Because multiple InterMapper installations can report to a single InterMapper
Database, when InterMapper registers with InterMapper Database, it supplies a
UUID to uniquely identify it. The InterMapper Database makes note of the URL and
other characteristics of the server and associates them with the UUID. If InterMapper Database receives the same UUID from a different URL, it generates the error above.
This may happen, for instance, if you copy your server settings from one copy of
InterMapper to another, or move InterMapper to a new host or IP address. Your choices are to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cancel</b> - Stop the registration of the server</li>
            <li><b>Force</b> - Force the UUID to be associated with the new URL. </li>
            <li><b>Regenerate</b> - Have InterMapper generate a new UUID.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are certain that the installation of InterMapper which has generated this
error is the same installation that was associated with the UUID previously, or
if you know it should replace it, you can choose "Force".</p>
        <p>If this is a different installation of InterMapper, choose "Regenerate".</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> <i>It is important to pay attention to this error;</i> map ids, device ids, etc., are
only unique within a given server; if you associate a completely different
installation of InterMapper with an existing UUID, the information about maps,
etc. on the old server will be replaced or updated by information from the new
server. When that occurs, datapoints from completely different datasets may be associated as if they were from one dataset.</p>
