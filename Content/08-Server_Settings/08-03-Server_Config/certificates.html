            <MadCap:keyword term="Certificate" />SSL Certificates</h1>
        <p>InterMapper's web and remote servers can employ a certificate to encrypt 
	the data going between the server and clients. This assures that the client 
	has connected to the actual server, and not another server acting as an 
	impostor. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="IP" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="OK" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Browse" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Encrypted" />InterMapper ships with a certificate signed by Help/Systems Inc. This will work; 
	the data is encrypted. But it's not using strong encryption (that is, it's 
	easily broken) and web browsers using HTTPS connections will give a warning 
	that there is a problem with the certificate, and that the data might be intercepted 
	in transit. </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Create" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="CSR:create" />To get stronger encryption and verification that the server is authentic, 
	you can create and install your own SSL certificate. This is a three-step 
	process:<br /></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Send:CSR" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Generate:CSR" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Copy:CSR" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Create:CSR" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Create:Certificate Signing Request" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="CSR" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Pending.csr:Certificate Signing Request" />Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). The CSR contains 
	 all the information needed to identify the computer. InterMapper has a built-in 
	 function for collecting this information and building the certificate.</li>
            <li>Sign the CSR. Signing is a process where an authority verifies 
	 the information in the certificate.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Uploading:Signed Certificate" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="Signed Certificate" />Upload the signed certificate into InterMapper to make it operational.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Send" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="CSR:send" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Certificate Authority" />In either case, you must first create a Certificate Signing Request 
 (CSR), which is a file that you can create using InterMapper. You then 
 sign the CSR yourself, or send it to a commercial Certificate Authority 
 to sign.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Server Configuration" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Server Settings window" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Server Settings" />Use the SSL Certificate panel, available from the Server Configuration section 
 of the Server Settings window to create a Certificate Signing Request, 
 and to upload a signed certificate to the InterMapper server.</p>
        <p>The remainder of this topic describes the three separate steps in detail.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Create a Certificate Signing Request</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Edit menu" />From the Edit menu, choose <i><b>Server Settings...</b></i> 
			The Server Settings window appears.</li>
            <li>In the Server Configuration section, click <b><i>SSL 
			Certificate</i></b>. The SSL Certificate panel appears.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Create new CSR...</b> The Certificate Signing 
			Request window appears, as shown below.</li>
            <li>Enter the required information as described below, 
			and click <b><i>OK</i></b><MadCap:keyword term="Generate" /><MadCap:keyword term="Generate:1,024-bit" /><MadCap:keyword term="Copy" /><MadCap:keyword term="Save" /><MadCap:keyword term="CSR:copy" /><MadCap:keyword term="CSR:generate" /><MadCap:keyword term="Private Key" />. A 1,024-bit private key is generated for 
			your computer, and the information is then used to create the Certificate 
			Signing Request. The key and a copy of the CSR are saved in the        <i>InterMapper 
			Settings:Certificates</i><MadCap:keyword term="Save File dialog" /> folder, and a standard Save File dialog 
			appears.<br /><br /><MadCap:keyword term="FullyQualifiedDomainName.csr" />You are being asked to save a copy of the CSR (with a filename of 
			the FullyQualifiedDomainName.csr) on your disk. We recommend you save 
			this on the desktop so it's easy to find when you create a signed 
			certificate. After you have requested a signed certificate, you can 
			discard this file.</li>
            <li>Click <b><i>Save</i></b>. The new certificate is saved 
			in the specified location.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Enter the following information for your 
 Certificate Signing Request: </h2>

            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Make new private key</b>
                <br />The first time you generate a CSR, this box is dimmed. On subsequent 
 uses, select this check box to create a new private key. Leave it unchecked 
 to use the same private key.</li>
            <li><b>Key Size</b>
                <br />Choose 1024 or 2048 bits.</li>
            <li><b>Digest Type</b>
                <br />Choose SHA1 or SHA2. SHA1 is the default value.</li>
            <li><b>Digest Size</b>
                <br />If you choose SHA2, choose 256 or 512 bits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you click the OK button, InterMapper generates a private key for your computer, then use the information entered above 
 to create the Certificate Signing Request. InterMapper will save following 
 files in the <i><MadCap:keyword term="InterMapper Settings" />InterMapper Settings:Certificates</i> folder:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;"><MadCap:keyword term="SSLCertificateKeyFile" />SSLCertificateKeyFile</b> 
 contains your private key </li>
            <li><b style="font-weight: bold;"><MadCap:keyword term="Pending.csr" />Pending.csr</b> the 
 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will also be asked to save another copy of the CSR (with a filename 
 of the <i>FullyQualifiedDomainName</i>.csr) on your disk. We recommend 
 you save this on the desktop so it's easy to find when you are ready to 
 create a signed certificate. You may discard this file after you have 
 requested a signed certificate. </p>
        <h2>Step 2: Sign the Certificate</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="CSR:CSR file" />Once you have a CSR file, you must have it signed. There are two ways 
		 to do<br />this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="OpenSSL" /> You can use the OpenSSL software (available from <a href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a>) 
			or<br /><MadCap:keyword term="Windows CA" />use the Windows CA to sign this CSR. This will create a self-signed 
			certificate<br />that you can easily use within your own organization.</li>
            <li> You can send the CSR to any of several commercial certificate authorities,<br /><MadCap:keyword term="InstantSSL" />such as InstantSSL (<a href="http://www.instantssl.com">http://www.instantssl.com</a><MadCap:keyword term="Verisign" />), 
			Verisign<br />(<a href="http://www.verisign.com/products/site/index.html">http://www.verisign.com/products/site/index.html</a><MadCap:keyword term="Thawte" />), 
			or Thawte<br />(<a href="http://www.thawte.com">http://www.thawte.com</a>). These 
			companies return a signed certificate that is globally-recognizable as authentic.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Uploading" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Signed Certificate:Uploading" />Step 3: Uploading the Signed Certificate</h2>
        <p>After the certificate has been signed, you can upload it using <i><b>Upload 
		 new<br />Certificate...</b></i> Either copy and paste the text of the certificate 
		 into this window, or click        <i><b>Browse...</b></i><br />and locate the certificate file on your hard drive.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/serversettings-UploadCSR.png" />
        </p>
        <p>At the conclusion of this, the InterMapper Settings:Certificates folder 
		 contains<br />files named:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SSLCertificateKeyFile</b> contains your private key, created 
			above.<br /></li>
            <li><b><MadCap:keyword term="SSLCertificateFile" />SSLCertificateFile</b>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Pem" /> contains your signed certificate (the 
			file from Verisign, InstantSSL, or OpenSSL.) Be sure to remove any 
			suffix (such as ".pem") from the file name.<br /></li>
            <li><b><MadCap:keyword term="SSLCACertificateFile" />SSLCACertificateFile</b> contains the public certificate chain 
			of the signing CA's (in order). <br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="SSL/TLS" />Stop the affected server from the Server Settings window, and then 
		 start it again. These certificates are then used for HTTPS and InterMapper 
		 Remote client connections if the SSL/TLS boxes are checked in the respective 
		 server settings.</p>
        <h2 class="pagebreakbefore">Using an externally generated CSR and Private Key</h2>
        <p>If you use a different application from InterMapper to create your Certificate 
 Signing Request (CSR), InterMapper will not have access to the private 
 key used to create the CSR. To upload your certificate with the private 
 key, create one text file containing the signed certificate, the private 
 key, and the CA's public certificate chain (if included), and use the 
 "Upload new certificate..." button to upload this combined file. 
 </p>
        <h2><a name="notes"></a>Technical Notes</h2>
        <p>The design for this scheme is based on the SSL section of the Apache 
 Mod-SSL httpd.conf file.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For InstantSSL, the SSLCACertificateFile is the same as 
	 the ca-bundle file, described in <a href="http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-support/cert_installation/">http://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-support/cert_installation/</a><br /></li>
            <li>If there is no SSLCertificateKeyFile, InterMapper will look 
	 for the private key in SSLCertificateFile. <br /></li>
            <li>InterMapper will always load the additional CA certificates, 
	 if they exist, from SSLCertificateFile first, then it will check SSLCACertificateFile 
	 if it exists. <br /></li>
            <li>You can set up the configuration so 
	 one file, named SSLCertificateFile, contains everything. The file must contain a key, certification, and trust chain in that order, or the certificate is not imported properly.<br /></li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="CR's" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="CR's:LF's" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="LF's" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="LF's:CR's" />
                <MadCap:keyword term="CR-LF" />InterMapper will convert CR's to LF's in the file data before 
	 loading it. There's no need to worry about CR-LF translation issues. </li>
        </ol>
