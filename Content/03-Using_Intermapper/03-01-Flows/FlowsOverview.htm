        <h1 MadCap:conditions="Primary.print">InterMapper Flows™</h1>
        <p>InterMapper has always made it easy to see heavy traffic at a glance. Its charts show when traffic peaks, but not what it’s used for. </p>
        <p>InterMapper Flows™ is a feature of InterMapper that allows you to get deeper insight into the traffic on your network. It is a Flows analyzer that works with NetFlow, sFlow, JFlow, and cFlow, and can show the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top talkers and listeners</li>
            <li>Top protocols in use
</li>
            <li>Top conversations and sessions
</li>
            <li>Detailed session information to identify particular machines</li>
        </ul>

        <p>InterMapper Flows collects and stores Flows data from any device that supports its collection (Flows Exporter). For information on supported devices, see <a href="SupportedExporters.htm">Supported Exporters<MadCap:xref href="SupportedExporters.htm" target="" title="" alt="" MadCap:conditions="Primary.print" /></a> You can choose the available exporters from which you want to collect data.
